# Case Converter

https://hyperskill.org/projects/193

ABOUT

We work with texts quite often, and it's very sad when it turns out that the text should have been written in a different case.
Instead of editing it, you can create a simple application that does the job for us.

Project has 3 stages:

   1. "The converter" - Design the application page. Create the textarea element, buttons, and styles. 
   2. "Upper or lower?" - Add handlers for buttons and change the text case accordingly. 
   3.  "Save me" - Save the edited text as a .txt file. Generate and download it in the browser.
   
LEARNING OUTCOMES

While implementing this project, you will work with basic HTML elements. Create event handlers for click events and work with strings in JavaScript.
