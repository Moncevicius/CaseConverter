# Case Converter

https://hyperskill.org/projects/193

ABOUT

We work with texts quite often, and it's very sad when it turns out that the text should have been written in a different case.
Instead of editing it, you can create a simple application that does the job for us.

LEARNING OUTCOMES

While implementing this project, you will work with basic HTML elements. Create event handlers for click events and work with strings in JavaScript.
Find out how to generate files for downloading.

Project has 3 stages:

   1. "The converter" - Design the application page. Create the textarea element, buttons, and styles. 
   2. "Upper or lower?" - Add handlers for buttons and change the text case accordingly. 
   3.  "Save me" - Save the edited text as a .txt file. Generate and download it in the browser.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Every single stage information can be found inside 'Case Converter' folder. 
Upon going inside the folder and selecting specific stage, 'task.html' provides information what is required/needed to be done to complete the stage. 
'Task' folder, 'main.js' contains the final stage implementation including previous stages.

'Topics' folder contains exercises that are required to be solved prior to solving stages. 
By going inside the folder and selecting a topic, information about the exercise specific to the topic can be found inside 'task.html'
